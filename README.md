## 🧠 Feature Engineering  
New variables added to improve analysis quality:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `vehicle_age` | Age of the EV based on Model Year |
| `make_count` | Number of vehicles by each manufacturer |
| `make_avg_range` | Average electric range per brand |
| `state_ev_count` | EV count per state |

These engineered features allowed deeper insights and better segmentation.
